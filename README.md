Github soft-wrap
================

This is a [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/pt-br/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) script that adds a "Soft wrap" button for every file and diff shown on page. This way, you can toggle soft-wrap for any type of file, either disabling soft-wrap for prose diffs (which are [enabled by default](https://github.com/blog/1707-soft-wrapping-on-prose-diffs)) or enabling them for any other diff or file.
